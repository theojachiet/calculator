# calculator
Final project of the foundation !! <br>
This calculator project was really nice and a way to practice my event listeners and triggers and also
a deeper understanding of the conditions, equalities, edgecases...<br>
Added the decimal and keyboard support and backspace options. There are still cases where the calculator behaves weirdly : 
you can edit the error message if you try to divide by 0... But nothing that could break it completely.<br>
Last thing i could do is add a text hiding effect when the number is too long because it's going out of the screen right now but
it's only for really large numbers so i don't really care for now.
